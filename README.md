# ðŸ¦ˆ Shark Attack Analysis

## Overview
This project involves analyzing shark attack data to uncover patterns and insights. It was developed as part of a university assignment where I applied data science techniques to explore trends and possible solutions related to shark attacks.<br/>

## Objectives
- **Data Cleaning**: Prepare the dataset by handling missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.<br/>
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Identify trends, patterns, and correlations within the data.<br/>
- **Visualization**: Create compelling visualizations to illustrate key findings.<br/>
- **Modeling**: Develop predictive models to assess factors contributing to shark attacks.<br/>

## Tools & Technologies
- **Programming Languages**: Python<br/>
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib <br/>


## How to Run the Project
1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/Fabs1999/Data-science-Project.git`<br/>
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd shark-attack-analysis`<br/>
3. Install necessary dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`<br/>
4. Run the analysis: `python analysis.py`<br/>

## Conclusion
This project provided valuable experience in data wrangling, analysis, and visualization. The findings offer insights into patterns of shark attacks and can be used for further study or preventive measures.<br/>
